# VNAV_Profile_CADscript
Command script to create VNAV surfaces in FreeCAD

The ultimate aim of this project is to have a user input the procedure variables with a GUI, and then the script will automatically draw
all the required protection surfaces from the end of the intermediate segment (i.e. the inteface with the FAF), to the end of the
intermediate missed approach (i.e. the turning point or enroute/msa altitude).

The surfaces will help visualise the protection area extent both laterally and vertically. 

A provision is made to exaggerate the heights, to better visualise the sloping surfaces.

Follow up will be plotting obstacles and eventually evaluating the obstacles against the surfaces.
